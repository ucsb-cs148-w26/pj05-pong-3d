I used Codex 5.3 in VSCode to create a camera controller with screen shake. I found that the output was good, but more complicated than I required while having too many hardcode values. I think it might be useful going forward, but will require significant scaffolding and tech specs to create something useful. I looked over all of the code myself to ensure it was correct and modified it heavily to trim down the fat. I chose Codex 5.3 because it creates fair use outputs.

I use ChatGPT (Vscode’s Codex), Claude, and Copilot depending on different tasks. Basically, when I do git pull from main, I will use Copilot or Codex to read other’s code to let me catch up with what my teammates are doing and about the updates. And when doing code for my own task, if that is more backend related, I will use Claude to tell me what I need to do for this task and what file should I focus on for this task. And after I understand about the task, I will try to finish my first version of the code by myself and do some test cases for the code. If the code does not work as I expected, I will then use Codex (5.3) to find out the error because it could read my code directly that I do not need to send all code one by one to the Claude. And if that is more frontend related, I prefer to use Codex directly because it could be visualized to the screen and error message could be found in inspection, and so I could debug more quickly. To check if the output is correct, I always write some test case to check all functions.

I used chatgpt to give me a paddle skin based on the popular game fortnite.
The result took a lot of work to get it to look decent. I will not use AI going forward for skins because it is not fair use. I will not be using it for code either because it takes longer to review the output than for me to write it myself.

I used ChatGPT to help me implement the selector for ball skin in the lobby page. It also helped me with debugging. The bug was whenever I selected “hot_pink” or “neon_blue”, the created lobby still had “classic” as ball skin. In the end, we found the router was incorrectly reading cosmetics from req.cosmetics instead of req.body.cosmetics.

Ayala: 
For my Coding with AI experiment, I used ChatGPT (GPT-5-mini) to help prototype a React-based UI for a 3D Pong-inspired game by generating boilerplate code for the Paddle, Ball, and Arena classes in Three.js and explaining key physics concepts like collision handling and vector normalization. The AI output gave me a solid starting point, saving time on repetitive setup while helping me understand how the code functions. I verified the generated code by reading through it carefully, testing it in my project, and making sure all physics calculations worked correctly.

Dennis: 
This week, I was assigned to implement the Google OAuth system. I had no prior experience working with OAuth or using the Passport library in Node.js. To develop the functionality, I used a combination of ChatGPT and Claude. I first provided the relevant code files to ChatGPT and asked it to generate the Passport configuration. After receiving the output, I shared the generated code with Claude to review it. Once both models said the implementation looked correct, I added the Passport file to the codebase. Before committing the changes, I skimmed through the code to check for any redundant or unusual lines. Whenever I encountered parts I didn’t fully understand, I asked the LLMs to explain them so I could better grasp what the code was doing. After that, I ran the application locally to test the OAuth flow, and everything appeared to work as expected. Using two models from different providers helped me reduce the likelihood of bugs and increased my confidence in the generated code. However, I still made sure to review the implementation myself and verify that it worked correctly. Going forward, I plan to continue using this approach.

Wong: 
I used Copilot in VSCode, which uses ChatGPT and Claude internally. I used the autocomplete features and also the chat feature to complete basic refactoring tasks. It was helpful to avoid repetitive tasks, but required some adjustments to ensure the code worked and the comments made sense. I think it worked surprisingly well, but only given that I already know how to do the changes I wanted to make. I will make only limited use of Copilot in the future due to usage limits, ethical concerns, and that it shortcuts my workflow.
