# Sprint01 planning meeting

- Meeting time: 1/19/2026
- Meeting type: Sprint planning
- Team: All present

Discussion:

Identified the scope of MVP and created important user stories to begin the project to the Kanban board.
For the frontend part, we will focus on the game scene, such as controlling the paddle and ball physics.
This is towards the goal of creating the basis for the game arena where two or more people connect and play games together.
For the backend part, we will focus on lobby creation using websocket/HTTP. The lobbies will server as a point where users can join and play games together.
In the lobby, people in the same lobby should be able to chat with each other.
After these parts are done, we will connect these parts together for the MVP.
