Hi! I'm Ayala, a computer science student interested in graphics, game development, and systems-level programming.

For this project, I’m excited to work on a 3D Pong-style game with polished visuals and smooth gameplay. I’m particularly interested in camera control, physics-based ball movement, and improving player feedback through lighting, sound, and UI elements. I’d also like to explore adding optional features such as power-ups, different camera modes, or enhanced AI for single-player play.
