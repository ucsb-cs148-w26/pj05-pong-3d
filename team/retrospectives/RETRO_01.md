Overall:

- Start modularizing the code
- Start setting deadlines and being more timely
- Stop pushing to main branch and to high-traffic files like `main.js`
- Continue communicating with each other

## Action item

- Goal: Get better at modularization
- Change: Start separating new functionality into different files
- Measurement: Check diffs with main files and count merge conflicts

## Assessment

- We had everyone record their start stop continue ideas, discussed them as a
  group and chose the most important ones
- We grew together and are now stronger; have better plans of how to proceed
- We advise future retro leaders to ensure everyone has a chance to voice their
  opinion

## Experiment/change

01/30: Our new PRs are working with separate files whenever possible, and we
have had no merge conflicts so far. We also only push notes but not any code to
main, ensuring all critical changes are reviewed.
