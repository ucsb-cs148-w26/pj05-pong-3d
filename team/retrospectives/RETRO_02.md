## Action item

- Goal: Get tasks done on time
- Change: Set a deadline (Thursday night) for all tickets
- Measurement: Check whether all tickets are in in-review state

## Retro Assessment

- We had everyone record their start stop continue ideas, discussed them as a group and chose the most important ones.
- We grew together and are now stronger; have better plans of how to proceed.
- I advice that future leaders to ensure everyone has a chance to share their ideas

## Experiment/change

- Our major goal for this retro was to get PRs in by Thursday night. We decided to make sure our team leaders have enough time to review the PRs and merge it before the Friday's deadline.
- However, only 29% of the team had the PR before Friday, which is far below the expectation. As a result, most PRs were still submitted on Friday, creating a heavy workload for the team leads. This led to increased stress and required the team to stay up late to complete reviews and merged before the deadline.
- Since this experiment wasn't successful, we will not continue with the current approach as-is. Instead, we plan to implement a more structured solution to encourage earlier PR submissions, such as setting a mid-week checkpoint, and breaking tasks into smaller deliverables earlier in the week. Our goal stays to have PRs submitted by Thursday, but we must refine our strategy for better outcome.
