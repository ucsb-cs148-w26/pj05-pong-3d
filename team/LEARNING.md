# Learning Plan

We have seven members in the team. Three people have familiarity to web development, while the rest has no experience.
For example, Wong has a lot of experience in both frontend and backend. Bobby knows well about websockets and graphics/shaders.
However, all of us virtually has no experience with Three.js, so it will be our first time using it.
Indeed, we can strategically pair, but we think the better plan is to assign people to the part they reall want to learn, and get help from other team members when necessary.
This is because doing what we want to do is more important than learning efficiently.

Most of our team lacks experience in working as a team, especially with wide-ranging skill gap.
People who are experienced will prioritize learning how to teach others to create a product, while the others will prioritize getting familiar with the web environment.
