# User Journey

Users want to play a quick, simple, yet competitive game to pass the time.

As a 3D pong player, I can:

- enter matchmaking so that they can find players to play with
- play with bots so that they can play the game even if no other players are online
- play in large groups so that they can experience what it's like to be in a community
- move the paddle so that they can hit the ball
- customize their paddle and play area so that they can express their individuality
- send chat messages so that they can socialize with others
- experience immersive, beautiful graphical effects so that their experience is more engaging
