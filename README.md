## Audience
The target audience is casual game players primarily seeking to pass the time. This includes players who enjoy easy-to-play games.
Users, not only immersing in a slow yet rich game with their friends or strangers, but they can also appreciate high-quality visuals and sound effects.
Users will mostly spend their time playing this game, but they will also develop skills such as hand-eye coordination.
We offer intriguing gameplay for maximum immersion, and also competitive variants to motivate players to play more and at a higher level.

## Tech Stack
Frontend: Three.js
Backend: Express (Node.js)
Our goal was to create a simple and light web game that was playable in desktop browsers. Since the game is 3D, our best option was Three.js for frontend.
It is better to keep the backend the same language, not to mention that one of our team members has prior experience with Express.

## Plan for the Project
The plan for the project is a real-time multiplayer game based on Pong. Each player takes the role of a Pong paddle (a 3d rectangle) and has to defend one side of a polyhedral. Each side/player has a certain amount of health; if the ball hits the side they die. The goal is to be the last one standing.

## User Roles
- Player. Someone who plays the game.
- Spectator. Someone who can join and watch a game.
